# Source this script in the Jenkins "Execute shell" build action to have all
# test artifacts and the console log uploaded at the end of the test run.

# For example, you might use the following snippet as the first few lines:
#
# if [[ -f ./hack/jenkins/upload-to-gcs.sh ]]; then
#   source ./hack/jenkins/upload-to-gcs.sh
# else
#   curl -fsS -o upload-to-gcs.sh --retry 3 "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/master/hack/jenkins/upload-to-gcs.sh" && source upload-to-gcs.sh; rm -f upload-to-gcs.sh
# fi

# Note that this script requires the Jenkins shell binary to be set to bash, not
# the system default (which may be dash on Debian-based systems).
# Also, for magicfile support to work correctly, the "file" utility must be
# installed.
