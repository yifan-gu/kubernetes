// This test must run [Serial] due to the impact of running other parallel
// tests can have on its performance.  Each test that follows the common
// test framework follows this pattern:
//   1. Create a Namespace
//   2. Do work that generates content in that namespace
//   3. Delete a Namespace
// Creation of a Namespace is non-trivial since it requires waiting for a
// ServiceAccount to be generated.
// Deletion of a Namespace is non-trivial and performance intensive since
// its an orchestrated process.  The controller that handles deletion must
// query the namespace for all existing content, and then delete each piece
// of content in turn.  As the API surface grows to add more KIND objects
// that could exist in a Namespace, the number of calls that the namespace
// controller must orchestrate grows since it must LIST, DELETE (1x1) each
// KIND.
// There is work underway to improve this, but it's
// most likely not going to get significantly better until etcd v3.
// Going back to this test, this test generates 100 Namespace objects, and then
// rapidly deletes all of them.  This causes the NamespaceController to observe
// and attempt to process a large number of deletes concurrently.  In effect,
// it's like running 100 traditional e2e tests in parallel.  If the namespace
// controller orchestrating deletes is slowed down deleting another test's
// content then this test may fail.  Since the goal of this test is to soak
// Namespace creation, and soak Namespace deletion, its not appropriate to
// further soak the cluster with other parallel Namespace deletion activities
// that each have a variable amount of content in the associated Namespace.
// When run in [Serial] this test appears to delete Namespace objects at a
// rate of approximately 1 per second.
