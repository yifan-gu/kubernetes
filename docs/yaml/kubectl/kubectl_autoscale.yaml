name: autoscale
synopsis: |
  Auto-scale a Deployment, ReplicaSet, or ReplicationController
description: |-
  Creates an autoscaler that automatically chooses and sets the number of pods that run in a kubernetes cluster.

  Looks up a Deployment, ReplicaSet, or ReplicationController by name and creates an autoscaler that uses the given resource as a reference.
  An autoscaler can automatically increase or decrease number of pods deployed within the system as needed.
options:
- name: cpu-percent
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: |
    The target average CPU utilization (represented as a percent of requested CPU) over all the pods. If it's not specified or negative, the server will apply a default value.
- name: dry-run
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it.
- name: filename
  shorthand: f
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Filename, directory, or URL to a file identifying the resource to autoscale.
- name: generator
  default_value: horizontalpodautoscaler/v1beta1
  usage: |
    The name of the API generator to use. Currently there is only 1 generator.
- name: include-extended-apis
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, include definitions of new APIs via calls to the API server. [default true]
- name: max
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: |
    The upper limit for the number of pods that can be set by the autoscaler. Required.
- name: min
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: |
    The lower limit for the number of pods that can be set by the autoscaler. If it's not specified or negative, the server will apply a default value.
- name: name
  usage: |
    The name for the newly created object. If not specified, the name of the input resource will be used.
- name: no-headers
  default_value: "false"
  usage: When using the default output, don't print headers.
- name: output
  shorthand: o
  usage: |
    Output format. One of: json|yaml|wide|name|go-template=...|go-template-file=...|jsonpath=...|jsonpath-file=... See golang template [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview] and jsonpath template [http://releases.k8s.io/HEAD/docs/user-guide/jsonpath.md].
- name: output-version
  usage: |
    Output the formatted object with the given group version (for ex: 'extensions/v1beta1').
- name: record
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation.
- name: recursive
  shorthand: R
  default_value: "false"
  usage: If true, process directory recursively.
- name: save-config
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. This is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.
- name: show-all
  shorthand: a
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    When printing, show all resources (default hide terminated pods.)
- name: show-labels
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    When printing, show all labels as the last column (default hide labels column)
- name: sort-by
  usage: |
    If non-empty, sort list types using this field specification.  The field specification is expressed as a JSONPath expression (e.g. '{.metadata.name}'). The field in the API resource specified by this JSONPath expression must be an integer or a string.
- name: template
  usage: |
    Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
inherited_options:
- name: alsologtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error as well as files
- name: api-version
  usage: |
    DEPRECATED: The API version to use when talking to the server
- name: as
  usage: Username to impersonate for the operation.
- name: certificate-authority
  usage: Path to a cert. file for the certificate authority.
- name: client-certificate
  usage: Path to a client certificate file for TLS.
- name: client-key
  usage: Path to a client key file for TLS.
- name: cluster
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use
- name: context
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig context to use
- name: insecure-skip-tls-verify
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure.
- name: kubeconfig
  usage: Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.
- name: log-backtrace-at
  default_value: :0
  usage: when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
- name: log-dir
  usage: If non-empty, write log files in this directory
- name: log-flush-frequency
  default_value: 5s
  usage: Maximum number of seconds between log flushes
- name: logtostderr
  default_value: "true"
  usage: log to standard error instead of files
- name: match-server-version
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Require server version to match client version
- name: namespace
  usage: If present, the namespace scope for this CLI request.
- name: password
  usage: Password for basic authentication to the API server.
- name: server
  shorthand: s
  usage: The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
- name: stderrthreshold
  default_value: "2"
  usage: logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
- name: token
  usage: Bearer token for authentication to the API server.
- name: user
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig user to use

  usage: |
    comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging
example: |-
  # Auto scale a deployment "foo", with the number of pods between 2 to 10, target CPU utilization at a default value that server applies:
  kubectl autoscale deployment foo --min=2 --max=10

  # Auto scale a replication controller "foo", with the number of pods between 1 to 5, target CPU utilization at 80%:
  kubectl autoscale rc foo --max=5 --cpu-percent=80
