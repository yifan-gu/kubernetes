name: delete
synopsis: |
  Delete resources by filenames, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector.
description: |-
  Delete resources by filenames, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector.

  JSON and YAML formats are accepted.

  Only one type of the arguments may be specified: filenames, resources and names, or resources and label selector

  Note that the delete command does NOT do resource version checks, so if someone
  submits an update to a resource right when you submit a delete, their update
  will be lost along with the rest of the resource.

  # Delete a pod using the type and name specified in pod.json.
  kubectl delete -f ./pod.json

  # Delete a pod based on the type and name in the JSON passed into stdin.
  cat pod.json | kubectl delete -f -

  # Delete pods and services with same names "baz" and "foo"
  kubectl delete pod,service baz foo

  # Delete pods and services with label name=myLabel.
  kubectl delete pods,services -l name=myLabel

  # Delete a pod immediately (no graceful shutdown)
  kubectl delete pod foo --now

  # Delete a pod with UID 1234-56-7890-234234-456456.
  kubectl delete pod 1234-56-7890-234234-456456
