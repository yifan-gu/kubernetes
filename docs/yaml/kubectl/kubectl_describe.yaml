  Show details of a specific resource or group of resources.

  This command joins many API calls together to form a detailed description of a
  given resource or group of resources.

  $ kubectl describe TYPE NAME_PREFIX

  will first check for an exact match on TYPE and NAME_PREFIX. If no such resource
  exists, it will output details for every resource that has a name prefixed with NAME_PREFIX

  Possible resource types include (case insensitive): pods (po), services (svc), deployments,
  replicasets (rs), replicationcontrollers (rc), nodes (no), events (ev), limitranges (limits),
  persistentvolumes (pv), persistentvolumeclaims (pvc), resourcequotas (quota), namespaces (ns),
  serviceaccounts (sa), ingresses (ing), horizontalpodautoscalers (hpa), daemonsets (ds), configmaps,
  componentstatuses (cs), endpoints (ep), and secrets.
