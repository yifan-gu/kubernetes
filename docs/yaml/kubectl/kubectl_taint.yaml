synopsis: Update the taints on one or more nodes
description: |-
  Update the taints on one or more nodes.

  A taint consists of a key, value, and effect. As an argument here, it is expressed as key=value:effect.
  The key must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores, up to 253 characters.
  The value must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores, up to 253 characters.
  The effect must be NoSchedule or PreferNoSchedule.
  Currently taint can only apply to node.

inherited_options:

  usage: Maximum number of seconds between log flushes
- name: logtostderr

example: |-
  # Update node 'foo' with a taint with key 'dedicated' and value 'special-user' and effect 'NoSchedule'.
  # If a taint with that key already exists, its value and effect are replaced as specified.
  kubectl taint nodes foo dedicated=special-user:NoSchedule
  # Remove from node 'foo' the taint with key 'dedicated' if one exists.
  kubectl taint nodes foo dedicated-
