    If non-empty, load/store cached API schemas in this directory, default is '$HOME/.kube/schema'
- name: timeout
  default_value: "0"

example: |-
  # Replace a pod using the data in pod.json.
  kubectl replace -f ./pod.json

  # Replace a pod based on the JSON passed into stdin.
  cat pod.json | kubectl replace -f -

  # Update a single-container pod's image version (tag) to v4
  kubectl get pod mypod -o yaml | sed 's/\(image: myimage\):.*$/\1:v4/' | kubectl replace -f -

  # Force replace, delete and then re-create the resource
  kubectl replace --force -f ./pod.json
