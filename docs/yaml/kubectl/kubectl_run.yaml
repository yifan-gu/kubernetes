synopsis: Run a particular image on the cluster.
description: |-
  Create and run a particular image, possibly replicated.
  Creates a deployment or job to manage the created container(s).
options:
- name: attach
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, wait for the Pod to start running, and then attach to the Pod as if 'kubectl attach ...' were called.  Default false, unless '-i/--interactive' is set, in which case the default is true.
- name: command
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true and extra arguments are present, use them as the 'command' field in the container, rather than the 'args' field which is the default.
- name: dry-run
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it.
- name: env
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: Environment variables to set in the container
- name: expose
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, a public, external service is created for the container(s) which are run
- name: generator
  usage: |
    The name of the API generator to use.  Default is 'deployment/v1beta1' if --restart=Always, otherwise the default is 'job/v1'.  This will happen only for cluster version at least 1.2, for olders we will fallback to 'run/v1' for --restart=Always, 'run-pod/v1' for others.
- name: hostport
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: |
    The host port mapping for the container port. To demonstrate a single-machine container.
- name: image
  usage: The image for the container to run.
- name: labels
  shorthand: l
  usage: Labels to apply to the pod(s).
- name: leave-stdin-open
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If the pod is started in interactive mode or with stdin, leave stdin open after the first attach completes. By default, stdin will be closed after the first attach completes.
- name: limits
  usage: |
    The resource requirement limits for this container.  For example, 'cpu=200m,memory=512Mi'
- name: no-headers
  default_value: "false"
  usage: When using the default output, don't print headers.
- name: output
  shorthand: o
  usage: |
    Output format. One of: json|yaml|wide|name|go-template=...|go-template-file=...|jsonpath=...|jsonpath-file=... See golang template [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview] and jsonpath template [http://releases.k8s.io/HEAD/docs/user-guide/jsonpath.md].
- name: output-version
  usage: |
    Output the formatted object with the given group version (for ex: 'extensions/v1beta1').
- name: overrides
  usage: |
    An inline JSON override for the generated object. If this is non-empty, it is used to override the generated object. Requires that the object supply a valid apiVersion field.
- name: port
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: |
    The port that this container exposes.  If --expose is true, this is also the port used by the service that is created.
- name: record
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation.
- name: replicas
  shorthand: r
  default_value: "1"
  usage: |
    Number of replicas to create for this container. Default is 1.
- name: requests
  usage: |
    The resource requirement requests for this container.  For example, 'cpu=100m,memory=256Mi'
- name: restart
  default_value: Always
  usage: |
    The restart policy for this Pod.  Legal values [Always, OnFailure, Never].  If set to 'Always' a deployment is created for this pod, if set to OnFailure or Never, a job is created for this pod and --replicas must be 1.  Default 'Always'
- name: rm
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, delete resources created in this command for attached containers.
- name: save-config
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. This is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.
- name: service-generator
  default_value: service/v2
  usage: |
    The name of the generator to use for creating a service.  Only used if --expose is true
- name: service-overrides
  usage: |
    An inline JSON override for the generated service object. If this is non-empty, it is used to override the generated object. Requires that the object supply a valid apiVersion field.  Only used if --expose is true.
- name: show-all
  shorthand: a
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    When printing, show all resources (default hide terminated pods.)
- name: show-labels
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    When printing, show all labels as the last column (default hide labels column)
- name: sort-by
  usage: |
    If non-empty, sort list types using this field specification.  The field specification is expressed as a JSONPath expression (e.g. '{.metadata.name}'). The field in the API resource specified by this JSONPath expression must be an integer or a string.
- name: stdin
  shorthand: i
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Keep stdin open on the container(s) in the pod, even if nothing is attached.

- name: tty
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Allocated a TTY for each container in the pod.  Because -t is currently shorthand for --template, -t is not supported for --tty. This shorthand is deprecated and we expect to adopt -t for --tty soon.
inherited_options:

  usage: log to standard error as well as files
